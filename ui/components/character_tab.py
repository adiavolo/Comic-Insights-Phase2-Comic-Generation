"""Character Management tab component for Comic Insights.

This module handles character creation, management, and consistency features:
- Character profile creation: Define and manage character details
- Visual trait management: Track and maintain character appearances
- Character relationships: Map connections between characters
- Expression and pose libraries: Store and reuse character poses

The tab provides tools for:
1. Creating and editing character profiles
2. Managing visual consistency across scenes
3. Organizing character relationships
4. Building expression and pose libraries

Technical Implementation:
- Uses Gradio components for the UI
- Implements error handling and logging
- Provides status tracking for operations
- Supports custom configuration via CharacterTabConfig
